# D Flip-Flop Test Bench

This repository contains a SystemVerilog test bench and related files to verify the functionality of a D flip-flop. The test bench is designed to thoroughly test the D flip-flop's behavior under different input conditions, ensuring correct operation and compliance with its specification.


## Introduction

The D Flip-Flop Test Bench project aims to validate the proper functioning of a D flip-flop. The test bench generates various test cases, including different input values, clock edges, and reset conditions. This approach ensures that the D flip-flop operates correctly and reliably according to its expected behavior.


## Important Notes

- PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT WRITTEN THE DESIGN, I HAVE ONLY VERIFIED IT
- design.sv IS NOT WRITTEN BY ME
- EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE BY ME
- sorry for shouting that out lol, I just wanted it to be seen

## Usage

To run the design verification test bench, follow these steps:

1. Visit this link: https://www.edaplayground.com/x/GMz7
2. Top right, hit login and create an account
3. Eda Playground might open a new playground for you, so go ahead and click on my link again to open my playground
4. On the left, click on "Open EPWave after run" under Tools & Simulators if you wish to analyze the waveforms
5. hit Run

During the simulation, the test bench will apply input stimuli to the D flip-flop, asserting various values of din. The design's outputs will be monitored and compared against expected results to detect any discrepancies or issues.
